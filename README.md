Defidisputes is "REKT for REG";  

It is a site that summarises the top stories in the world of crypto regulation and disputes, and is run by community for community.
We did a V1 here: https://defidisputes.com/

Its a place for lawyers, accountants, policy makers and the curious public to search for articles by topic area, and save time. 
Keeping on top of it all can be challenging! This makes life easier.

You can search by:

 - Country/Jurisdiction
 - Topic area: eg. "stablecoins", "ERC-721", "DEX"...
 
 There is a web 3 sign in with Ethereum, which allows you to vote up as well as comment on posts. You can also submit your own or other articles.
 
 The articles on the front page are ranked by recency, popularity and (initially) by moderator curation.
 
 In future we hope to use ML to be able to make this as unbiased as possible, similar to how REKT uses Twitter.
 
 The site is in development, but you can run it on your localhost to get a feel.
 
 I built it for my friends, as part of my grad project for Dev Academy, Wellington.
